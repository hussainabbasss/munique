## Blockers / assets needed from EB

- [ ] **`logo.png`** — High-res emblem seal (source of truth). Interim vector at `public/logo.svg`; swap to `logo.png` in components when asset arrives.
- [ ] Conference dates and venue city for facts row
- [ ] Secretariat names, roles, and portrait photos
- [ ] Sponsor logo files
- [ ] About page institutional copy (2+ sentences)
- [ ] **Supabase project** — run migration, set env vars from `.env.example`
- [ ] **Resend domain** — verify SPF/DKIM before go-live
- [ ] **Initial EB admin** — email for first `admin_users` seed
- [ ] **`payment-proofs` Storage bucket** — required for registration submit

## Anti-slop checklist

- [x] Parchment body `#E9DFC3` — not zinc/stone cream
- [x] No pill buttons on primary actions
- [x] No gradient text, glass nav, or grid overlay on hero
- [x] No section eyebrows or numbered markers
- [x] Index cards vary by content — not identical icon grid
- [x] No bounce/elastic easing; reduced-motion honored
- [x] No stock diplomacy hero photo
- [x] Geist/Inter removed from public pages
- [x] Seal motif only (no checkmark status icons)
- [ ] Contrast verification at 16px body (audit pending)
- [x] Seal alt text: "Munique 2026 official seal"
- [x] Admin uses `--paper-white` surfaces, monospace IDs, hairline tables
- [x] Registration: no fake payment verification progress bar
- [x] Registration: fee computed server-side
